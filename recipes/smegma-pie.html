    <h3>Smegma Pie (Serves 6)</h3>
    <p>Smegma pie is my bruncle's favourite dish to make. His secret to the best smegma pie was to make the creamy filling in my ass over a period of 4 days. Mama never liked the dish, but that was on account of it being derived from her son/brothers smegma and cum, and her son's (my) rectum.</p>
    <p>Smegma pie originated in Nova Scotia. It was a tradition founded by Columbus himself, Columbus McGee that is, the first autistic Canadian to lick his own nutsack. Columbus McGee is commemorated in many ways in Nova Scotia, the most notable benig a 3,000 lb cast iron replica of his nutsack that hangs from the McDonald bridge. We miss you Columbus McGee!  </p>
